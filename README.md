# Tik-Tac-Toe 

# OOP with three classes: Board, Player, Game

# Board:
# Allows for instantiation of a typical board display, with methods to adjust and    display the board

# Player:
# Allows for instantiation of a player with a name and marker, along with methods to make a move (mark a spot), and add move to an array of player's moves. Also uses attr_reader to allow for access of player's name, marker, and moves made.

# Game:
# Establishes constant win conditions and instantiates two players (player1 (X) and player2 (O)), a new board, and a array for storing all of the moves by player1 and player2. Methods include updating all moves, checking for game-winning conditions, and starting a new game.
